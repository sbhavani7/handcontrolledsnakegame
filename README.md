Hand Controlled Snake Game--(Mini Project)

The project involves creating a Snake game with an innovative twist by implementing hand gesture controls. 
Using Python, Pygame for game development, and OpenCV for computer vision, the game allows players to guide the snake's movement using recognized hand gestures captured through a webcam.

PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT:

The purpose of a hand gesture-controlled snake game is to provide an interactive and engaging user experience by allowing players to control the game using hand gestures instead of traditional input devices like a keyboard or joystick.
This project combines technology and entertainment, offering a novel and intuitive way to interact with the game.
